# Frequently asked questions

## Does Cal.com support a custom domain?
This is possible with our self-hosted option.

## Multi-bookings for events where more people can book at the same time
As it stands this is currently not possible. We always keep an eye on the limitations like these that our users point to us. Weâ€™ve had requests in the past for the multi-booking feature and this is on our priority list.
